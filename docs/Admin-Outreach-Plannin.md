# Admin Outreach System

## Overview

### Problem

Administrators often struggle with communicating with the right students effectively. Currently, they rely on mass emailing, which results in cluttered inboxes, students ignoring important announcements, and messages not reaching the right people. For example, an admin might just want to contact the class of 2027 computer science students only.

### Solution

The Admin Outreach System allows administrators to precisely target students based on attributes such as major, year, enrollment status, and program.

## Goals

- Have **targeted communication** to specific student groups  
- **Reduce inbox clutter**  
- **Improve student engagement**

## General Features

### Student Targeting

Administrators select recipients using filters such as:

- Major / department  
- Graduation year  
- Program type (undergraduate, graduate, etc.)  
- Enrollment status  
- Other relevant student attributes  

The system should be **dynamic**: as student attributes change, targeting updates automatically.

## Philosophy Behind the System

- Prioritize **relevant messages** instead of mass emailing  
- Always ask: **what type of student** should receive the message?  
- All targeting and messaging should be done with **clear, intuitive UI controls**  

## Inspiration from Existing Software

- Submitty, Blackboard: structured announcements for clearly defined groups

## Breakdown into Actionable Tasks

### Planning

- Define student attributes  
- Define admin roles and permissions  
- Figure out how to obtain and synchronize student data  

### Backend

- Design and implement the database schema  

### Frontend

- Build the admin UI  
- Build the student email/notification feed  

### Delivery

- Integrate email and in-app notifications  

## Bugs Found While Creating Events

- Changing time and location after making an event  
- For QR code colors: when copying and pasting the hex color, the color preview box does not reflect the correct color
